You can log every url you added to path.Because logger works at middleware.
I only added 2 url paths to show how this simple logger works.
Which are /page1 and /page2

When you go to one of the urls above,log.json and log.txt will be created automatically in the project folder.
Also you can check the log table in db.sqlite3 which is this project's default database.

**Just a very simple middleware logger**
